Feedback from different systems/distro releases/desktop environment combinations is appreciated, expecially regarding the binary component and eventual missing dependencies.

= Details =

Testing release with latest changes:
 * Moved Tray handling functions to a new javascript XPCOM component to avoid problems when the first window is closed (see Issue 79)
 * Applied patch for Gecko2 support (Issue 127)
 * Added option to select between "unread" and "new" messages notification (Issue 120)
 * Added option to hide tray icon when not minimized (Issue 92)
 * Added option to disable showing mail count into messages notification icon
 * Dynamic creation of install.rdf
 * Exclude mails from special folders (Archive, Sent, Templates, Drafts) from message count

= Notes =

"new" messages count is not working yet. I suggest using unread count.
