WISHES (from wiki)

- Enable the user to close all firefox windows while still keeping firefox in the tray and add a menu item to the tray icon "open new window

- Clicking the tray icon with the middle mouse button fetches new messages (would be best with the icon changing to something else to indicate that the process is in progress).

- Ability to exclude spam folder(s) from the unread messages control.

- Enable the user to close any of firefox windows individually

- Close button only closes to tray when there is only one window up
