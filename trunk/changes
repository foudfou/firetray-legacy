TODO:
 
  - windows position bug when using XRDC 
  - missing close confirmation request in some situations (issue 44)

  - fix FF3.5+ and TB3+ icon problems with some images

  - close single window menu element (Issue 32)
   
  - save windows z-order 


WISHES (from wiki)

- Enable the user to close all firefox windows while still keeping firefox in the tray and add a menu item to the tray icon "open new window

- Clicking the tray icon with the middle mouse button fetches new messages (would be best with the icon changing to something else to indicate that the process is in progress).

- Enable the user to close any of firefox windows individually

- Close button only closes to tray when there is only one window up
